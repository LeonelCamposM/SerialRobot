# MobileRobot

## Overview
The MobileRobot project embodies the spirit of DIY and the maker movement, focusing on hands-on experience in building and programming robots. It is a testament to the joy of creating something tangible and interactive, merging the physical with the digital. This repository serves as a testament to the adventure of constructing a personal robot and the rich learning experiences that come with integrating various software technologies and experimenting with hardware modifications.

## Problem Statement
The journey of learning robotics is as much about the process as it is about the outcome. In a field dominated by pre-built solutions, there's immense educational value in getting your hands dirty with the nuts and bolts of robot construction. MobileRobot is more than a platform; it's an ongoing experiment that encourages the exploration of software technologies and hardware modifications. It is for those who find excitement in not just operating a robot, but in understanding and crafting the very elements that make it tick.

## Features
- **SumoBot**: A competitive sumo wrestling mode that challenges other robots in power and strategy.
- **Remote Operation**: Control the robot from a distance, offering a wide range of applications from remote surveillance to telepresence.
- **OpenBot Interface**: Integrates with the OpenBot framework to leverage smartphones as an intelligent onboard control system.
